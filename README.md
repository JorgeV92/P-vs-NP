# $\mathcal{P}$ $\text{vs}$ $\mathcal{NP}$

Welcome to the $\mathcal{P}$ vs. $\mathcal{NP}$ project, where I delve into the fascinating world of computational complexity, focusing on the $\mathcal{P}$ vs. $\mathcal{NP}$ problem. This project aims to explore various reduction techniques to transform problems into one another, demonstrating these concepts through the OCaml functional programming language. I hope to learn as much as possible about this topic, review papers and books, and write extensive notes from my algorithm courses. Ultimately, I aim to develop a formal method for exploring reductions in programming.
