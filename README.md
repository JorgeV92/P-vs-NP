# $\mathcal{P}$ $\text{vs}$ $\mathcal{NP}$

Welcome to the $\mathcal{P}$ vs. $\mathcal{NP}$ project, where I delve into the world of computational complexity, focusing on the $\mathcal{P}$ vs. $\mathcal{NP}$ problem. This project aims to explore various reduction techniques to transform problems into one another, demonstrating these concepts through the OCaml functional programming language and possibly python to make it easier for others to use and read the code as well. I hope to learn as much as possible about this topic, review papers and books, and write extensive notes from my algorithm courses. Ultimately, I aim to develop a formal method for exploring reductions in programming.
